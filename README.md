# Calibre "Find Duplicates" Plugin with Merge Duplicate Functionality

This is a fork of kiwidude's "Find Duplicates" plugin that allows for merging duplicates.

Merging duplicates can be dangerous, you can lose metadata or versions of a book if you aren't careful. You must use this plugin with care. Take note of the GPL-3 license included: there is no warranty, nothing is guaranteed.

kiwidude did the bulk of the work that makes this possible. You should thank them for their hard work, and take a look at their repository of other really useful calibre plugins. Developers, kiwidude also has a lot of really interesting information about learning to develop your own calibre plugins! https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins

More information on how this was developed can be found at my blog post. If you're interested in learning how to contribute to an open source project but think you can't because you don't know enough, I recommend reading it!

# Calibre's "Find Duplicates" Plugin

There is a plugin for Calibre that allows for many methods of finding duplicate books.
The thread where discussion and development of this plugin occurs appears
to be [here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131017). Thus, I
believe the primary developer to be "kiwidude" on the mobileread.com forums.

However, I was unable to find a public git (or other version control) repository
for this plugin, and I wanted to contribute further functionality. So, until
I can figure out how the primary developer prefers to receive contributions (if at all),
I've uploaded the entire plugin here, along with a commit for my change.

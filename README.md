# Calibre "Find Duplicates" Plugin with Merge Duplicate Functionality

This is a fork of kiwidude's "Find Duplicates" plugin that allows for merging duplicates.

Merging duplicates can be dangerous, you can lose metadata or versions of a book if you aren't careful. You must use this plugin with care. Take note of the GPL-3 license included: there is no warranty, nothing is guaranteed.

kiwidude did the bulk of the work that makes this possible. You should thank them for their hard work, and take a look at their repository of other really useful calibre plugins. Developers, kiwidude also has a lot of really interesting information about learning to develop your own calibre plugins! https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins
